## <img style='width:32px;height:32px' src='/assets/vector/tor.svg'/> Privately with TOR
The safest and most private way to use RoboSats is through the Onion address. You need [Tor Browser](/docs/tor/).

## <i class="fa-solid fa-window-maximize"></i> Unsafe in Clearnet
There is an unsafe way to view RoboSats without TOR that relies on third party tor2web services. With this URL you can access RoboSats from any browser, but using this URL is highly unrecommended!

> [unsafe.robosats.com](https://unsafe.robosats.com)

Take it for granted: if you use that link, you are being spied on. However, most sensitive tools will be disabled (e.g. the chat) to avoid users giving away sensitive personal data.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-person-dots-from-line"></i> All in one

In order to more easily remember how to access, we have set up robosats.com . If you are using Tor Browser, it will directly take you to the Onion Site. Otherwise, it will take you to the unsafe site.

#### Testnet
You can practice and test all of the functionalities in RoboSats without of losing funds by using [Testnet Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet). All you need is a Testnet Lightning wallet and access the testnet platform

> [<b>robotest</b>agw3dcxmd66r4rgksb4nmmr43fh7<br/>7bzn2ia2eucduyeafnyd.onion](http://robotestagw3dcxmd66r4rgksb4nmmr43fh77bzn2ia2eucduyeafnyd.onion/)

Or unsafely on the testnet clearnet bridge.

#### Clearnet Mirrors
There are several tor2web services that serve as mirrors in case one of them is unavailable

> [unsafe3.robosats.com](https://unsafe3.robosats.com/) <br/>
